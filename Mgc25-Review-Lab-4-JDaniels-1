Looking at this solution I see the library itself in Visual Studio is set up correctly. When looking at the code the class is named and set up 
with appropriate properties, however there are no separate constructors present for the class. I would like to see a constructor present that 
can accept fields from the calling code, as well as a default constructor if there are issues with the calling code so the program doesnâ€™t crash.
Also, I would like to see some comments describing the major parts of the class and clarifying the lab name, author name, etc. to help keep up with whose code it is.
